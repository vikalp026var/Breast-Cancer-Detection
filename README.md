Logging & Exceptions

    Logging: The logger.py within the src directory takes care of logging throughout the model. This helps in keeping a track of events, debugging and ensuring smooth operation.

    Exceptions: The exception.py contains custom-defined exceptions that help in better error handling. This is integral for robustness and stability during model training and prediction.
